# zeno
A minimalist Content Management Framework with only the essential to run a business on the internet.

## manifesto
- The majority of the corporate websites has the same structure: **a bunch of pages of content and a contact page.**
- The majority of the e-commerce websites has the same structure: **a bunch of categorized products, a shopping cart, and a checkout page.**
- This project borns with that in mind: **let's do only the essential to accomplish our goal.**

The majority of the companies does not change their structure or way of doing business on a monthly basis, so why they have to update their websites everytime that a new Javascript Framework is launched or a new way of photo sliding is created? If you are tired of dealing with websites upgrades that went wrong, for you or your clients, this project borns with a desire to solve that.
